# Captcha-recognition-TF

A cool project using deep learning to decaptcha

## Getting Started

Project using deep learing with tensorflow framework to recognition 5 digits captcha.
Using convolutional neural network, this project is so powerful but also requires a lot of data.
Data is captchas generated by [Captcha-php](https://github.com/dukn/Captcha-php).

In this project, I have 2 main file:

- `training_captcha.py`: Training model
- `recognition.py`: Recognition captcha 

### Prerequisites

<!-- What things you need to install the software and how to install them-->
You must have knowledge of deep learning and tensorflow to understand it.
Also you need to install the following libs:

```
python2.7
tensorflow
numpy
pickle
matplotlib
scipy
```

### Installing

Here I will direct you to install on linux (Ubuntu).
You can do the same on Windows and MacOS yourself.

Install tensorflow, you can follow the detailed instructions [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux) 
or below:
```
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev   # for Python 2.7
$ sudo pip install tensorflow      # Python 2.7; CPU support (no GPU support)

```

Install numpy and scipy 

```
$ sudo pip install numpy scipy
```

Install cpickle :
```
$ sudo pip install cpickle
```

Install matplotlib:
```
$ sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib
```

It's so easy!

## Running the tests

Generated Captchas and put them at `./Captcha/lv3/` and lable at `./Captcha/pass3.txt`.

Train model by run `training_captcha.py`:
```
$ python training_captcha.py
```
And supervise youself. 
You can break with `Ctrl + C` whenever you want.


Recognition by run `recognition.py`:
```
$ python recognition.py 
```
